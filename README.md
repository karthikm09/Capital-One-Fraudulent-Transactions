# Capital-One-Fraudulent-Transactions

**Problem Statement:**

1. Fraud is a problem for any bank. Fraud can take many forms, whether it is someone stealing a single credit card, to large batches of stolen credit 
card numbers being used on the web, or even a mass compromise of credit card numbers stolen from a merchant via tools like credit card skimming devices.

2.You will notice a number of what look like duplicated transactions in the data set.
One type of duplicated transaction is a reversed transaction, where a purchase is followed by a reversal.
Another example is a multi-swipe, where a vendor accidentally charges a customer's card multiple times within a short time span.
